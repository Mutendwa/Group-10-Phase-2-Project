# Understanding Trends in Property Market Value in Washington

This project aims at analysing various factors including: structural features, location, and temporal factors, to understand what influences global housing prices.

## Project description
In this project we look at:

* What is the combined influence of structural features, location, and temporal factors on the market price of houses, and how can we optimally model these relationships to predict housing prices with high accuracy?
* Is there a statistically significant difference in lot size (sqft_lot) among houses with varying grades?
* Do houses with a waterfront view have a significantly higher average price compared to houses without a view?
* To what extent does the combined influence of bedrooms and bathrooms affect the price of a house?

The following challenges were encoutered:
* Limited data
* High multicollinearity within the variables in the dataset.

## Project needs
* Data Processing and cleaning
