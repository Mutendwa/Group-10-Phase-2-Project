# Understanding Trends in Property Market Value in Washington

This project aims at analysing various factors including: structural features, location, and temporal factors, to understand what influences global housing prices. 

## Business Understanding

The real estate agency aims to provide comprehensive services to homeowners looking to buy or sell their properties. One significant aspect of their services involves advising homeowners on potential renovations that could increase the estimated value of their homes. This guidance is crucial in assisting homeowners in making informed decisions about investing in renovations that will yield a favourable return on investment (ROI) when they decide to sell their property.

## Project description
In this project we look at:

* What is the combined influence of structural features, location, and temporal factors on the market price of houses, and how can we optimally model these relationships to predict housing prices with high accuracy?
* Is there a statistically significant difference in lot size (sqft_lot) among houses with varying grades?
* Do houses with a waterfront view have a significantly higher average price compared to houses without a view?
* To what extent does the combined influence of bedrooms and bathrooms affect the price of a house?

The following challenges were encoutered:
* Limited data
* High multicollinearity within the variables in the dataset.

## Recommendations
* The shareholder should encourage homeowners to do renovations so as to improve the overall condition and raise the property's grade as this has a great impact on the value of a house. 

* There is also high impact of square footage of living space on house prices and use this information to justify higher listing prices for properties with more extensive square footage.
   
* The number of bathrooms and bedrooms also have a positive correlation with the value of a house. Therefore, during renovation adding a bedroom would increase the value of the house! 

* For price prediction of the houses, we recommend use of Polynomial regression model as it gives a high R- squared value which means that we can get a better and more accurate price value.
